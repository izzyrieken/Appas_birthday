      Happy Birthday Appa!<br>
      I love you!<br>
      Thank you for being the best dad I could ask for.<br>
      You are the most supportive person I know and has always pushed me to be my best.<br>
      I don't know who I'd be without you because we are somehow so alike<br>
      I'm so proud to be your daughter not just because you have the best Dad jokes but because you are pretty badass.<br>
      You always inspire to do what I love and I'm so thankful for that guidance throughout my life.<br>

    </p>
